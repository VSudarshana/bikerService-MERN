## Project Overview

This project is a bike service station management application that allows users to book bike services and manage service stations. The app is designed with two main interfaces:
- **Admin Interface**: Manages bookings and service statuses.
- **User Interface**: Allows customers to register, log in, and book bike services.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure the following:
- You have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.
- You have a MongoDB database running (locally or through a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas).

## Installation

To set up the Bike Service Application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bikeService-MERN.git
    cd bikeService-MERN
    ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

1. In the `backend` folder, create a `.env` file with the following values:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    PORT=5000
    ```

Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` and `your_jwt_secret` with appropriate values.

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Key Files and Structure

### Frontend (React)
- **`src/App.js`**: Main React component managing routing and structure.
- **`src/index.js`**: Entry point for rendering the app.

### Backend (Express)
- **`server.js`**: Entry point for the Express server.
- **`config/database.js`**: MongoDB connection setup.
- **`routes/`**: Defines API routes (e.g., `authRoutes`, `serviceRoutes`).
- **`controllers/`**: Handles logic for each route (e.g., `authController`, `serviceController`).
- **`models/`**: Defines MongoDB data schemas (e.g., `userModel`, `serviceModel`).

## Dependencies

### Backend
- `express`: Web framework
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling
- `bcryptjs`: Password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken`: Token-based authentication
- `cors`: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- `dotenv`: Environment variable management

### Frontend
- `react`: Frontend library
- `react-router-dom`: Routing for React
- `axios`: HTTP client for API requests
- `react-bootstrap`: Bootstrap components in React

## Data Flow

1. Users interact with the **React frontend** to book services or manage bookings.
2. API requests are made to the **Express backend**.
3. The backend interacts with **MongoDB** to store or retrieve booking and service data.
4. Responses are sent back to the frontend to update the user interface.

## Deployment

To deploy the Bike Service Application:

1. Set up a MongoDB database (e.g., [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).
2. Deploy the backend to a Node.js hosting service (e.g., [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)).
3. Deploy the frontend to a static site hosting platform (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)).

Ensure all environment variables are set correctly during deployment.
